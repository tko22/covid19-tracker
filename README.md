# Covid 19 Tracking

To track data, I'm interested in. A lot of news outlets don't show per capita data but just numbers, which don't always show the full picture. 

Main Data source is [covidtracking.com](https://covidtracking.com) and county data is taken from [jhu](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) via my [covid api](https://github.com/tko22/covid-api)



## Dev
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
